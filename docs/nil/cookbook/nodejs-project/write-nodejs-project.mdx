# Write a Node.js project utilizing `Nil.js`

This short recipe shows how `Nil.js` can be used in a small-scale Node.js project. 

## Project set-up

First, create a new file titled `server.js` in an environment where Node.js is installed.

Then, import the following components and initialize the following variables:

```ts showLineNumbers file=../../../tests/nodeJsProject/server.js start=startImport end=endImport
```

## Server code

Our server will initialize a new wallet and, once wallet creation ends, show its address in the browser window:

```ts showLineNumbers file=../../../tests/nodeJsProject/server.js start=startServer end=endServer
```

## Interacting with the server

To launch the server:

```
node path/to/server.js
```

After the server is launched, open `http://127.0.0.1:3000/` in the browser and wait a couple of seconds while the project creates a new wallet.

Alternatively, run the following snippet to fetch the wallet address once the server calculates it:

```ts showLineNumbers
const response = await fetch("http://127.0.0.1:3000/");
const text = await response.text();
console.log(test);
```
