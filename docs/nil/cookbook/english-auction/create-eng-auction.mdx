# Create an NFT auction

The 'English Auction' consists of two parts:

* A contract representing an NFT
* A contract containing the auction logic

## Draft the NFT contract

The full code of the NFT contract:

```solidity showLineNumbers file=../../../tests/NFT.sol start=startContract end=endContract
```

The contract overrides the inherited `onlyExternal` methods for minting and burning, ensuring fine control over the total supply of the NFT. It also provides a 'wrapper' method for transferring a minted NFT to another contract.

## Implement the auction contract

### Contract definition

The initial contract definition and import statements:

```solidity showLineNumbers
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@nilfoundation/smart-contracts/contracts/Nil.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

/**
 * @title EnglishAuction
 * @author =nil; Foundation
 * @notice This contract implements an auction where contracts can place bids
 * @notice and the contract owner decides when to start and end the auction.
 */
contract EnglishAuction is Ownable {}
```

In addition to `Nil.sol`, the contract imports `Ownable.sol`. This is done so that only the contract owner can manage when the auction starts and end.

### Contract properties and constructor

The auction contract has the following constructor and properties:

```solidity showLineNumbers file=../../../tests/EnglishAuction.sol start=startContractProperties end=endContractProperties
```

The auction is deployed by taking the address of the NFT contract and setting the initial `highestBid`. Bid information is kept in the `bids` mapping while the `highestBidder` is a separate property for convenience.

### Auction logic

The contract contains three functions responsible for handling the auction logic:

```solidity showLineNumbers file=../../../tests/EnglishAuction.sol start=startAuctionLogic end=endAuctionLogic
```

The `start()` and `end()` functions are marked as `Ownable` so that only the contract owner can start and end the auction. When the auction begins, the contract sends a transaction for minting the NFT and starts accepting bets. After the auction concludes, a new async call is sent so that the NFT is transferred to the winner.

### Full code

Here is the full code of the auction contract:

```solidity showLineNumbers file=../../../tests/EnglishAuctionPure.sol start=startContract end=endContract
```

<PGButton name="EnglishAuctionPure.sol"/>
