# Deploy and test the multi-signature wallet

This test of the multi-signature wallet does the following:

* Implements a special multi-signature signer and a 'helper' class representing the multi-signature wallet
* Creates two new 'regular' wallets and uses one of them to deploy the multi-signature wallet
* Creates a message signed by both wallets and sends it to the multi-signature wallet

## Import statements

```ts showLineNumbers file=../../../tests/cookbook-multisig.test.mts start=startImportStatements end=endImportStatements
```

## Auxiliary functions

The `refineFunctionHexData()` function is a special 'helper' function that encodes calldata after passing several checks:

```ts showLineNumbers file=../../../tests/cookbook-multisig.test.mts start=startRefineFunctionHexData end=endRefineFunctionHexData
```

## The multi-signature signer and wallet

The `MultisigSigner` class creates multi-signatures given an array of keys while the `MultiSigWallet` class provides an abstraction over sending external messages to the multi-signature wallet contracts:

```ts showLineNumbers file=../../../tests/cookbook-multisig.test.mts start=startHelpers end=endHelpers
```

## Usage flows

The example creates three new private keys and two new wallets. Note that the second wallet does not have to be deployed:

```ts showLineNumbers file=../../../tests/cookbook-multisig.test.mts start=startInitialUsageFlow end=endInitialUsageFlow
```

The `hexKeys` array is an array of hex strings representing the generated private keys. It is passed to the constructor of the multi-signature wallet contract to deploy it:

```ts showLineNumbers file=../../../tests/cookbook-multisig.test.mts start=startMultiSigDeployment end=endMultiSigDeployment
```

After the multi-signature wallet is deployed, a transfer request is placed using the `sendTransaction()` abstraction:

```ts showLineNumbers file=../../../tests/cookbook-multisig.test.mts start=startTransfer end=endTransfer
```

The expected balance of `walletTwo` should be equal to `convertEthToWei(0.000001)`.
