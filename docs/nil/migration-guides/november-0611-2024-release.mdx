# Release 06.11.2024: migration guide

This release of =nil; simplifies operations with the `TokenId` type by adding new comparison operators. The =nil; CLI can set the RPC endpoint of the Cometa service, removing the need to modify the Cometa config file manually. Usage of the =nil; Hardhat plugin no longer requires passing the `--network nil` flag to Ignition deployments and tasks.

## Summary of key changes

* `Nil.sol` now allows for easy comparisons of `TokenId` via new comparison operators and 'wrapper' functions
* `Nil.js` includes bindings for using the Cometa service
* The =nil; CLI can set the Cometa RPC endpoint for use with the `nil cometa` command
* The =nil; CLI can top-up the balances of smart contracts without needing a smart account
* The previously mandatory `--network nil` flag has been removed for Ignition deployments and tasks in the =nil; Hardhat plugin
* The endpoints for the Cometa service and [**the Faucet service**](../key-principles/tokens.mdx#token-faucet-service) have been merged with the standard `http://api.devnet.nil.foundation/api/$USERNAME/$TOKEN` endpoint

## Migration of smart contracts

* Use more comparison operators with the `TokenId` type

The `TokenId` type now supports additional comparison operators including `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=`. The `Nil.sol` library also includes new 'wrapper' functions that apply these operators to the `TokenId`s passed as their arguments.

## Migration of =nil; CLI commands

* Add the Cometa RPC endpoint to the =nil; CLI config

Prior to using the Cometa service via the =nil; CLI, set its RPC endpoint via the `nil config set cometa_endpoint COMETA_ENDPOINT` command. Note that this action is not required for using other CLI commands for interacting with the cluster.

[**Read this tutorial**](../guides/cometa-and-debugging.mdx) to learn more about the Cometa service.

* Top-up smart contracts without needing a smart account

The =nil; CLI can now be used to top-up smart contracts without requiring a smart account:

```bash
nil contract top-up CONTRACT_ADDRESS AMOUNT Token_ID
```

## Migration of `Nil.js` scripts

* Use the new Cometa service bindings in `Nil.js` scripts

The `Nil.js` package now contains several 'helper' functions and classes for interacting with the Cometa service. To access the service, simply initialize a new `CometaClient` and then call `compileContract()` and `registerContract()`.

More information about the `Nil.js` Cometa bindings is given in [**the references section**](../reference/client/index.mdx).

* Remove `await` statements when using the the `signer.getPublicKey()` and `signer.getAddress()` functions

These functions have become synchronous and the `await` statement no longer influences their results.

* Remove all usages of the `smartAccount.getAddressHex()` function

Instead, use the `smartAccount.address` property. It contains the smart account address as a `Hex` value.

## Migration of Hardhat scripts

* Remove the `--network nil` flag from Ignition deployments and tasks

The =nil; Hardhat plugin no longer requires passing the `--network nil` flag when deploying a contract or running a task using Ignition.
