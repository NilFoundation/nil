# Release 14.01.2025: migration guide

This release changes the way gas is calculated for [**outgoing messages**](../core-concepts/shards-parallel-execution.mdx#message-passing-checks) and modifies the default gas price across the cluster.

## Summary of key changes

* All outgoing messages require paying extra gas

## Migration of smart contracts

* Allocate extra gas to operations that spawn outgoing messages

The gas required to be paid for outgoing messages now depends on a variable titled `extraGasPercent`. How this variable is calculated depends on the gas price at the shard where an outgoing message is sent.

If the gas price at the destination shard (`destShardGasPrice`) is lower than the default gas price (`defaultGasPrice`):

$$
extraGasPercent = \min(100, (destShardGasPrice - defaultGasPrice) / (defaultGasPrice / 100))
$$

Otherwise:

$$
extraGasPercent = 0
$$

The required amount of gas for outgoing messages is calculated as follows:

$$
requiredGas = forwardFee + extraForwardFeeStep * extraGasPercent
$$

, where `forwardFee` is `1000` and `extraForwardFeeStep` is `100`.

* Increase gas paid for all messages

Default gas price has been changed from `10` to `100` across the cluster. This means that more `feeCredit` needs to be paid for the execution of all messages.
