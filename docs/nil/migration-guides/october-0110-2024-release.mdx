# Release 01.10.2024: migration guide

This release of =nil; fixes several issues and bugs related to async request chaining, `feeCredit` estimations, and gas forwarding.

## Summary of key changes

* The cluster now handles async call chains (two or more async calls following each other) more reliably
* Several function names in `Nil.sol` have been changed to be more representative of what these functions do
* `Nil.currencyBalance()` produces more accurate results
* `Nil.sendRequest()` and `Nil.awaitCall()` require purchasing gas for processing the response, which guarantees that said response will always be executed

## Migration of smart contracts

* Change usage of `sendRequest()` and `awaitCall()`

Both `sendRequest()` and `awaitCall()` have new signatures in the latest release:

```solidity showLineNumbers
 function sendRequest(
        address dst,
        uint256 value,
        uint responseProcessingGas,
        bytes memory context,
        bytes memory callData
    ) internal {}
 
 function awaitCall(
        address dst,
        uint responseProcessingGas,
        bytes memory callData
    ) internal returns(bytes memory, bool) {}
```

The `responseProcessingGas` argument is the amount of gas that has to be reserved for processing the response to `sendRequest()` and `awaitCall()`. The specified amount is immediately purchased when the function is called and is later spent to guarantee that the response is executed correctly.

:::tip

Use the `Nil.ASYNC_REQUEST_MIN_GAS` constant value to reserve the minimum possible amount of gas for processing an async response.

:::

* If needed, change `asyncCall()` and `sendRequest()` to `asyncCallWithTokens()` and `sendRequestWithTokens()`

To reduce enthropy in the function names and their overloads, the variants of `asyncCall()` and `sendRequest()` that sent custom currencies to other contracts have been renamed to `asyncCallWithTokens()` and `sendRequest()` with tokens, respectively. It is now impossible to send custom currencies when using `asyncCall()` and `sendRequest()`.
