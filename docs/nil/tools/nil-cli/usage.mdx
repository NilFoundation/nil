# =nil; CLI usage

There are several steps that need to be completed before using the =nil; CLI.

## Create a new config file

To create a config file for the =nil; CLI:

```bash file=../../../tests/commands.mjs start=startConfigCommand end=endConfigCommand
```

## Set the RPC endpoint

Initially, the =nil; CLI is unaware of the RPC endpoint for interacting with the cluster.

To set the RPC endpoint:

```bash file=../../../tests/commands.mjs start=startEndpoint end=endEndpoint
```

## Set the faucet endpoint

The =nil; CLI can use [**the faucet service**](../../getting-started/essentials/tokens-multi-currency.mdx#currency-faucet-service) to top-up smart contracts with a range of currencies. 

To set the faucet endpoint:

```bash file=../../../tests/commands.mjs start=startFaucetEndpointCommand end=endFaucetEndpointCommand
```

Setting the faucet endpoint is mandatory for creating a new wallet.

## Set the Cometa endpoint

The CLI can also use the Cometa service to assist with [**smart contract debugging**](../../guides/cometa-and-debugging.mdx). 

To set the Cometa endpoint:


```bash file=../../../tests/commands.mjs start=startCometaCommand end=endCometaCommand
```

## Create a new private key

Creating a new private key is the next logical step before creating a new wallet.

```bash file=../../../tests/commands.mjs start=startKeygen end=endKeygen
```

## Create a new wallet

At this point, the only remaining action is to create a new wallet:

```bash file=../../../tests/commands.mjs start=startWallet end=endWallet
```

After running this command, the =nil; CLI should be fully ready to interact with the cluster.
