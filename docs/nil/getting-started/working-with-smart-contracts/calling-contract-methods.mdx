# Calling methods inside smart contracts

This tutorial outlines how to interact with [**the tutorial smart contracts**](./writing-a-contract) given the developer tools provided by =nil;.

## Prerequisites

Complete the following tutorials before proceeding.

* [**Writing a contract**](./writing-a-contract)
* [**Deploying a contract**](./deploying-a-contract)

## Using internal messages

### Via the =nil; CLI

To call the `orderProduct()` function inside the retailer contract and trigger an async call:

```bash
nil_cli wallet send-tokens RETAILER_ADDRESS 5000000
nil_cli wallet send-message RETAILER_ADDRESS orderProduct MANUFACTURER_ADDRESS new-product --abi path/to/Retailer.abi
```

Make a readonly call to access the value:

```bash
nil_cli contract call-readonly MANUFACTURER_ADDRESS getProducts --abi path/to/Manufacturer.abi
```

The CLI should output the decoded values automatically.

### Via the client library

To send funds to the retailer product and call the `orderProduct` method:

```ts showLineNumbers
const hashFunds = await faucet.withdrawToWithRetry(addressR, 5_000_000n);

await waitTillCompleted(client, 1, hashFunds);

const hashProduct = await wallet.sendMessage({
  to: addressR,
  data: encodeFunctionData({
    abi: RETAILER_ABI as Abi,
    functionName: "orderProduct",
    args: [addressM, "another-product"],
  }),
  gas: 100000n,
  value: 1000000n,
});

await waitTillCompleted(client, 1, hashProduct);

console.log("Product created!");
```

To receive and decode the currently created products:

```ts showLineNumbers
import {
  decodeFunctionResult,
  encodeFunctionData,
} from "viem";

const resultsCall = await client.call(
  {
    from: addrM,
    to: addrM,
    data: encodeFunctionData({
      abi: MANUFACTURER_ABI as Abi,
      functionName: "getProducts",
      args: [],
    }),
  },
  "latest",
);

console.log(
  "getProducts",
  decodeFunctionResult({
    abi: MANUFACTURER_ABI as Abi,
    functionName: "getProducts",
    data: resultsCall,
  }),
);
```

## Using external messages

### Via the =nil; CLI

The CLI currently does not support sending external messages that modify the internal state of smart contracts or spawn internal messages. As a result, sending an external message to a function that performs an async call to another function will fail. 

In the retailer contract, the `orderProduct()` function cannot be called externally as it makes an async call to the manufacturer.

### Via the client library

To order a new product using the retailer:

```ts showLineNumbers
const orderMessage = new ExternalMessageEnvelope({
  isDeploy: false,
  to: hexToBytes(RETAILER_ADDRESS),
  chainId,
  seqno: await client.getMessageCount(RETAILER_ADDRESS, "latest"),
  data: hexToBytes(
    encodeFunctionData({
      abi: RETAILER_ABI as Abi,
      functionName: "orderProduct",
      args: [addrM, "new-product"],
    }),
  ),
  authData: new Uint8Array(0),
});

const encodedOrderMessage = orderMessage.encode();

const orderMessageHash = await client.sendRawMessage(
  bytesToHex(encodedOrderMessage),
);

await waitTillCompleted(client, 1, orderMessageHash);
```

To receive and decode the currently created products:

```ts showLineNumbers
import {
  decodeFunctionResult,
  encodeFunctionData,
} from "viem";

const resultsCall = await client.call(
  {
    from: addrM,
    to: addrM,
    data: encodeFunctionData({
      abi: MANUFACTURER_ABI as Abi,
      functionName: "getProducts",
      args: [],
    }),
  },
  "latest",
);

console.log(
  "getProducts",
  decodeFunctionResult({
    abi: MANUFACTURER_ABI as Abi,
    functionName: "getProducts",
    data: resultsCall,
  }),
);
```

## Via the Hardhat plugin

Calling smart contract methods via the Hardhat plugin requires creating Hardhat tasks.

Ordering a product from the manufacturer:

```typescript showLineNumbers
import { task } from "hardhat/config";

task("orderProduct", "Orders a product")
  .addParam("retailer", "The address of the Retailer contract")
  .addParam("manufacturer", "The address of the Manufacturer contract")
  .addParam("product", "The name of the product")
  .setAction(async (taskArgs, hre) => {
    const Retailer = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("Retailer");
    const retailer = Retailer.attach(taskArgs.retailer);

    console.log("Ordering the product...");
    const setterTx = await retailer.orderProduct(taskArgs.manufacturer, taskArgs.product);
    await setterTx.wait(0);
  });
```

Retrieving the currently ordered products:

```typescript showLineNumbers
import { task } from "hardhat/config";

task("getProducts", "Gets the current products")
  .addParam("manufacturer", "The address of the Manufacturer contract")
  .setAction(async (taskArgs, hre) => {
    const Manufacturer = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("Manufacturer");
    const manufacturer = Manufacturer.attach(taskArgs.manufacturer);

    console.log("Getting products..");
    const products = await manufacturer.getProducts();

    console.log(products);

  });
```

Execute the following commands to run the newly created tasks:

```bash
npx hardhat orderProduct --manufacturer MANUFACTURER_ADDRESS --retailer RETAILER_ADDRESS --product PRODUCT_NAME --network nil
```

```bash
npx hardhat getProducts --manufacturer MANUFACTURER_ADDRESS --network nil
```

The Hardhat plugin should decode the results of the call and show the new product directly in the terminal.
