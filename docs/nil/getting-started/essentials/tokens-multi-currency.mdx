# Tokens and multi-currency support

This tutorial explains how =nil; handles tokens and multi-currency operations.

## Definition

=nil; supplies a basic 'default' currency that is distributed by the `Faucet` contract. 

The network also has a multi-currency mechanism. All accounts (smart contracts) can be paid in any number of arbitrary currencies created either by the account owner or other accounts. Currency creation is dedicated to a special precompiled contract (`Minter`), and anyone can request the creation, minting, and withdrawal of new currencies. 

:::info

While custom currencies can be transferred between accounts, they cannot be used for paying for essential functionalities of =nil; such as deploying contracts or sending async calls.

:::

:::info

When a currency is created, it is assigned an ID derived from the address of the currency owner. A contract can only be the owner of one currency. Only messages from the owner are processed for a custom currency: non-owners cannot mint it or transfer it between accounts.

:::

## Usage

### Via the CLI

To create a new currency and immediately withdraw it to the address of the owner:

```bash
nil_cli minter create-currency OWNER_ADDRESS AMOUNT NAME --withdraw
```

To mint a currency:

```bash
nil_cli minter create-currency OWNER_ADDRESS AMOUNT
```

To send an existing currency (with some amount already minted) from a minter to another contract:

```bash
nil_cli minter withdraw-currency OWNER_ADDRESS AMOUNT RECEIVER_ADDRESS
```

### Via the client library

:::tip

To get the ID of a currency, simply call the `hexToBigInt()` function on the owner's address.

:::

To create a new currency and withdraw it:

```ts showLineNumbers
import {
  MINTER_ABI,
  MINTER_ADDRESS,
  waitTillCompleted,
} from "@nilfoundation/niljs";

const hashMessage = await wallet.sendMessage({
  to: MINTER_ADDRESS,
  gas: 1_000_000n,
  value: 100_000_000n,
  data: encodeFunctionData({
    abi: MINTER_ABI,
    functionName: "create",
    args: [100_000_000n, walletAddress, "MY_TOKEN", walletAddress],
  }),
});

await waitTillCompleted(client, 1, hashMessage);
```

To mint a currency and withdraw it:

```ts showLineNumbers
import {
  MINTER_ABI,
  MINTER_ADDRESS,
  waitTillCompleted,
} from "@nilfoundation/niljs";

import { encodeFunctionData } from "viem";

const hashMessage = await wallet.sendMessage({
  to: MINTER_ADDRESS,
  gas: 1_000_000n,
  value: 100_000_000n,
  data: encodeFunctionData({
    abi: MINTER_ABI,
    functionName: "mint",
    args: [CURRENCY_ID, AMOUNT, walletAddress],
  }),
});

await waitTillCompleted(client, 1, hashMessage);
```

To send an existing currency (with some amount already minted) from a minter to another contract:

```ts showLineNumbers
import {
  MINTER_ABI,
  MINTER_ADDRESS,
  waitTillCompleted,
} from "@nilfoundation/niljs";

import { encodeFunctionData } from "viem";

const hashMessage = await wallet.sendMessage({
  to: MINTER_ADDRESS,
  gas: 1_000_000n,
  value: 100_000_000n,
  data: encodeFunctionData({
    abi: MINTER_ABI,
    functionName: "withdraw",
    args: [CURRENCY_ID, AMOUNT, walletAddress],
  }),
});

await waitTillCompleted(client, 1, hashMessage);
```

## Example

This example creates a wallet that stores three currencies: the default token, and two custom currencies.

### Via the CLI

Create two new wallets (Wallet 1 and Wallet 2):

```bash
nil_cli wallet new
nil_cli wallet new --salt 1
```

Create a new currency for Wallet 1 and withdraw it:

```bash
nil_cli minter create-currency WALLET_ONE_ADDRESS 50000 token --withdraw
```

Create a new currency for Wallet 2 and keep it in the minter:

```bash
nil_cli minter create-currency WALLET_TWO_ADDRESS 30000 another-token
```

Withdraw the second currency to Wallet 1:

```bash
nil_cli minter withdraw-currency WALLET_TWO_ADDRESS 15000 WALLET_ONE_ADDRESS
```

Check the currencies for Wallet 1:

```bash
nil_cli contract currencies WALLET_ONE_ADDRESS
```

The following response should appear:

```bash
Contract currencies:
Balance: 50000 CurrencyId=[CURRENCY_ID_ONE]
Balance: 15000 CurrencyId=[CURRENCY_ID_TWO]
```

Check the balance of Wallet 1 in default tokens:

```bash
nil_cli contract balance WALLET_ONE_ADDRESS
```

```bash
Contract balance: BALANCE
```

### Via the client library

Create two new wallets:

```ts showLineNumbers
import { encodeFunctionData, hexToBigInt } from "viem";
import {
  Faucet,
  HttpTransport,
  LocalECDSAKeySigner,
  MINTER_ABI,
  MINTER_ADDRESS,
  PublicClient,
  WalletV1,
  generateRandomPrivateKey,
  waitTillCompleted,
} from "@nilfoundation/niljs";

const wallet = new WalletV1({
  pubkey: pubkey,
  salt: BigInt(Math.floor(Math.random() * 10000)),
  shardId: 1,
  client,
  signer,
});
const walletAddress = await wallet.getAddressHex();

await faucet.withdrawToWithRetry(walletAddress, convertEthToWei(1));
await wallet.selfDeploy(true);

const walletTwo = new WalletV1({
  pubkey: pubkey,
  salt: BigInt(Math.floor(Math.random() * 10000)),
  shardId: 1,
  client,
  signer,
});
const walletTwoAddress = await walletTwo.getAddressHex();

await faucet.withdrawToWithRetry(walletTwoAddress, convertEthToWei(1));
await walletTwo.selfDeploy(true);
```

Create a new currency for Wallet 1 and withdraw it:

```ts showLineNumbers
const currencyCreationMessage = await wallet.sendMessage({
  to: MINTER_ADDRESS,
  gas: 500_000n,
  value: 100_000_000n,
  data: encodeFunctionData({
    abi: MINTER_ABI,
    functionName: "create",
    args: [10_000n, walletAddress, "token", walletAddress],
  }),
});

await waitTillCompleted(client, 1, currencyCreationMessage);
```

Create a new currency for Wallet 2 and send it to Wallet 1:

```ts showLineNumbers
const currencyCreationMessageTwo = await walletTwo.sendMessage({
  to: MINTER_ADDRESS,
  gas: 500_000n,
  value: 100_000_000n,
  data: encodeFunctionData({
    abi: MINTER_ABI,
    functionName: "create",
    args: [20_000n, walletTwoAddress, "new-token", walletAddress],
  }),
});

await waitTillCompleted(client, 1, currencyCreationMessageTwo);
```

Check the currencies for Wallet 1:

```ts showLineNumbers
const tokens = await client.getCurrencies(walletAddress, "latest");
console.log("Tokens of Wallet 1: ", tokensTwo);
```
