# Running the =nil; daemon

## Overview

`nild` is the =nil; daemon that can be used to run a local copy of the =nil; cluster. It can be configured to perform various services:

* *validator node*, processing transactions and creating new blocks
  in one or more shards;
* *archive node*, storing the complete history of the blockchain;
* *RPC node*, providing API services to users and dApps;
* *Cometa service*, storing Solidity source code for smart contracts and assisting with debugging
* the _faucet_, distributing tokens to users of the =nil; testnet.

Cometa and faucet are provided by separate daemons in a production setting.

## Generating `nild`

To create the `nild` binary:

```
git clone https://github.com/NilFoundation/nil.git
cd nil
nix develop
make
```

The binary will be placed in the `./build/bin/` folder.

## Devnet in a single process

This setup runs =nil; as a fully standalone blockchain with multiple shards operating within a single process on one machine. Such a configuration is mostly used for testing and familiarizing oneself with zkSharding.

To run `nild` in this setup:

```bash
nild run --http-port=8529
```

This will launch the cluster locally with the following default settings:
* `--db-path ./test.db`: database stored in `./test.db` (this file is created if it does not exist, but it is not deleted if an incompatible old database is present);
* `--nshards 5`: 4 working shards, plus a main shard, all collated by this instance of `nild`;
* HTTP RPC API on `127.0.0.1:8529`, with the faucet API enabled;
* Cometa endpoint on `127.0.0.1:8528`.

If an incompatible old database is found in the specified `db-path`, `nild` will refuse to start by default. When working with test databases that can be safely discarded, use the `--allow-db-clear` option to automatically delete the incompatible database and proceed with running the cluster.

## Complete devnet with 2 validators, an archive node and an RPC node

To start a devnet with multiple validators, said validators need to be assigned with identities. This process involves generating cryptographic keys and bootstrap the network by informing validators
about each other. This can be achieved using the devnet generator, available through the `nild devnet` subcommand.

Write the devnet spec as a YAML file:

```yaml showLineNumbers
nild_config_dir: myDevnet/conf
nild_credentials_dir: myDevnet/creds
nild_p2p_base_tcp_port: 30303
nil_wipe_on_update: true
nShards: 5
nil_config:
  - { id: 0, shards: [ 0, 1 ], splitShards: true, dhtBootstrapPeersIdx: [1] }
  - { id: 1, shards: [ 2, 3, 4 ], splitShards: true, dhtBootstrapPeersIdx: [0] }
nil_archive_config:
  - { id: 0, shards: [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ], bootstrapPeersIdx: [ 0, 0, 1, 1 ], dhtBootstrapPeersIdx: [0, 1] }
nil_rpc_config:
  - id: 0
    dhtBootstrapPeersIdx: [ 0, 1 ]
    archiveNodeIndices: [ 0 ]
```

If needed, tweak the amount of shards and validators, the distribution
of shards between validators and other parameters. The `bootstrapPeersIdx` and
`dhtBootstrapPeersIdx` settings are lists of validators IDs in this
spec.

Then, save the spec to `myDevnet.yaml`.

Now, generate generate validator identities and config files:

```shell
$ nild gen-configs myDevnet.yaml --basedir myDevnet/var
```

The configuration files will be created in `myDevnet/conf`. Start the services by running:

```bash
$ nild run --config myDevnet/conf/nil-0  # start first validator
$ nild run --config myDevnet/conf/nil-1  # start second validator
$ nild archive --config myDevnet/conf/nil-archive-0  # start archive node
$ nild rpc --config myDevnet/conf/nil-rpc-0  # start RPC node
```

This setup does not launch the faucet service or the Cometa service. They have to be configured
and launched separately.
