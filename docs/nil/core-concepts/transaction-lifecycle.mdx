# Transaction lifecycle

## Definition

In =nil;, transactions pass the following stages before reaching finality.

1. A user submits a transaction via an external transaction
2. The transaction is sequenced and placed into the mempool of an execution shard
3. The transaction is bundled with other transactions and sent for execution
4. The transaction is executed and placed into a block. If the transaction spawns a cross-shard transaction, this cross-shard transaction is placed into the 'inbox' of its destination shard
5. The block passes local consensus
6. The block is placed into local storage and the transaction reaches soft finality
7. The block hash is sent to the consensus shard
8. The sync committee collects the block along with blocks from other shards
9. The block is aggregated into a batch, is compressed, and is sent to the L1 blob storage and to a zkSharding prover
10. The prover produces a ZKP and sends it to the sync committee
11. The sync committee sends a transaction proposing the new state to L1. This transaction contains the ZKP
12. L1 verifies that the data stored in the blob and the proven data is the same data
13. L1 verifies the ZKP. If the ZKP is valid, the transaction reaches hard finality once the block containing it is confirmed

:::note

Deposit transactions and transactions that are force-included via L1 will follow a slightly different flow.

Additional remarks about each of the above stages are given below.

## Stages

### Transaction submission and processing

A user submits an external transaction autonomously. Once sequenced, this transaction reaches the mempool of its target execution shard.

In some cases, transactions may also cause the receiving contract to call other smart contracts some of which may be located on other shards. As part of the =nil; protocol, execution shards poll other execution shards about cross-shard transactions. Once a cross-shard transaction is submitted, the destination shard retrieves it and processes it, potentially triggering new cross-shard transactions.

### Transaction execution

The collator retrieves transactions (both external and cross-shard) from the mempool and bundles them together for execution. The resulting bundle is executed, and the transaction is included in the new block produced by the execution shard.

At the end of this stage, the block is sent for verification via local consensus. 

[**Learn more about local consensus**](./shards-parallel-execution#consensus-shard).

### Achieving soft finality

After the block is built, its hash is sent to the consensus shard. The block with transactions is persisted in local storage, at which point the transaction reaches soft finality.

:::info

The sync committee collects blocks and the transaction data included in these blocks, aggregates them in a batch, and publishes the batch to L1 blob storage.

At this point, the transactions in the batch achieve a stronger soft finality. This way, the transaction is confirmed to be included in the L2 state.

:::note[State transition proof]

Once the batch has been aggregated by the sync committee, a proving request is sent to the network of proof producers.
A proof producer generates a ZKP attesting to the correct transition to the new state.

[**Learn more about this process.**](../architecture/finality.mdx)

:::

### Achieving hard finality

Once the ZKP is generated, the proof producer sends it back to the sync vcommittee which prepares an L1 state update transaction to the main =nil; L2 contract.

Afterward, L1 compares the data published to blobs and the data claimed for the new state. Finally, a verifier contract validates the ZKP. If valid, the new state is confirmed. When the corresponding Ethereum block is finalized, the transaction achieves hard finality.
