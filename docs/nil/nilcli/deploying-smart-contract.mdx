# =nil; CLI: deploying a smart contract

## Overview

This tutorial deploys two smart contracts:

* [**`Retailer.sol`**](https://github.com/NilFoundation/nil/blob/main/docs/tests/Retailer.sol): this contract can call a special 'manufacturer' contract and order new products by performing an async call.
* [**`Manufacturer.sol`**](https://github.com/NilFoundation/nil/blob/main/docs/tests/Manufacturer.sol): this contract can accept orders from the retailer and fulfil them by 'manufacturing' and sending new products.

## Internal deployment

To deploy the retailer via the =nil; CLI:

```bash file=../../tests/working-with-smart-contracts-cli.test.mjs start=startRetailerDeploymentCommand end=endRetailerDeploymentCommand
```

Take note of the address for the retailer. To retrieve the smart account public key:

```bash file=../../tests/commands.mjs start=startInfo end=endInfo
```

To deploy the manufactuer with the given public key and the address of the retailer contract:

```bash file=../../tests/working-with-smart-contracts-cli.test.mjs start=startManufacturerDeploymentCommand end=endManufacturerDeploymentCommand
```

This will make sure that `Manufacturer.sol` and `Retailer.sol` are on different shards.
