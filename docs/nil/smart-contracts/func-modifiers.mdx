# Function modifiers

The =nil; Solidity library provides several function modifiers that simplify the processing of external transactions and async calls.


## `onlyInternal` and `onlyExternal`

=nil; adds the following function modifiers:

* `onlyInternal`
* `onlyExternal`
* `onlyResponse`

If a function has the `onlyInternal` modifier, it can only be called by another contract regardless of where this contract is located. A function with the `onlyExternal` modifier behaves the opposite way: it must always be called via an external transaction (e.g., from a user).

The `onlyResponse` modifier limits makes it so a function can only be called as callback function when processing [**the response to `sendRequest()`**](../key-principles/async-execution.mdx).

:::info

It is technically possible to call a function marked with `onlyExternal`/`onlyInternal` modifier with transaction whose type is opposite to the type in the modifier. However, such a call will produce an error.

:::tip

To use the `onlyInternal`, `onlyExternal`, and `onlyResponse` function modifiers, the contract must use `NilBase` as its base contract.

## Examples

### `onlyInternal` and `onlyExternal`

Consider the below examples that simulate on-chain voting.

Contract 1 is a 'ballot' contract that is deployed for every voter:

```solidity showLineNumbers
import "@nilfoundation/smart-contracts/contracts/Nil.sol";

contract Ballot is NilBase {
    bytes pubkey;
    constructor(bytes memory _pubkey) payable {
        pubkey = _pubkey;
    }
    function vote(address election, string candidate) external onlyExternal {
        int feeCredit = 500_000;
        bool deploy = false;
        uint value = 0;
        election.asyncCall(
            address(this), feeCredit, value,
            abi.encodeWithSignature("requestVote(string)", candidate));
    }
    function verifyExternal(
        uint256 hash,
        bytes memory authData
    ) external view returns (bool) {
        return Nil.validateSignature(pubkey, hash, authData);
    }
}
```

Contract 1 contains the voter's public key. The `vote()` function can only be called externally by the voter for whom the ballot contract was deployed. This is made possible by the `verifyExternal()` function that validates the caller's signature.

Contract 2 records votes:

```solidity showLineNumbers
import "@nilfoundation/smart-contracts/contracts/Nil.sol";

contract Election {
    using Nil for address;
    mapping(address => string) public votes;
    mapping(address => bool) private voters; // Filled by the contract owner

    function requestVote(string candidate) public {
        address voter = msg.sender;
        if (voters[voter] != true) {
            return;
        }
        votes[voter] = candidate;
    }
}
```

Note that Contract 2 lacks the `verifyExternal()` function and, therefore, cannot accept external transactions. This means that `requestVote()` does not need to have the `onlyInternal` modifier. Vote verification in Contract 2 can only be initiated by another contract.

Contract 1 makes an async call to Contract 2 requesting vote registration. If the caller is a valid voter, the `votes` map is updated to include the new vote for the specified `candidate`. Careful use of modifiers and the `verifyExternal()` function means that the voting system cannot be abused: votes cannot be requested directly, and additional verification occurs at the level of the election contract.
