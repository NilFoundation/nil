# `smart-contracts`: working with tokens

## Overview

The `NilTokenBase.sol` contract allows for creating new custom tokens to be deployed on =nil;

To do so, simply inherit a new smart contract from `NilTokenBase.sol` and deploy it. 

```solidity showLineNumbers
import "@nilfoundation/smart-contracts/contracts/NilTokenBase.sol";

contract NewToken is NilTokenBase {}
```

`NilTokenBase.sol` provides internal methods for burning, minting and sending tokens, as well as [**`onlyExternal` wrappers**](./func-modifiers.mdx) over these methods.

## FT example

It is possible to implement a simple fungible token contract by inheriting from `NilTokenBase.sol`:

```solidity showLineNumbers file=../../tests/FT.sol start=startContract end=endContract
```

## NFT example

Here is a basic implementation of an NFT contract inheriting from `NilTokenBase.sol`:

```solidity showLineNumbers file=../../tests/NFT.sol start=startContract end=endContract
```

<PGButton name="NFT.sol"/>

The contract uses the `openzeppelin/Ownable.sol` contract to manage NFT ownership. It also overrides `onlyExternal` methods from `NilTokenBase.sol` to ensure that no one can burn or mint the NFT.
