# Handling async execution

To support [**cross-shard communication**](../architecture/sharding.mdx#cross-shard-communication), =nil; supports smart contracts making async calls to one another directly in Solidity code.

## Performing an async call

Consider a smart contract with the following code:

```sol showLineNumbers file=../../tests/CallerAsyncBasicPattern.sol start=startCallerAsyncBasicPattern end=endCallerAsyncBasicPattern
```

<PGButton name="CallerAsyncBasicPattern.sol"/>

The `asyncCall()` function makes it possible for the contract to call a function in another smart contract regardless of the shard where this contract is located. There are no additional actions required for making async calls: simply adding `asyncCall()` and specifying its arguments is sufficient.

:::info

The `asyncCall()` function is a shortcut for executing a precompiled contract responsible for managing async calls across the cluster.

:::

:::tip

To initiate an async call, the 'caller' contract must have sufficient funds to pay for initiating a new transaction.

:::

:::info[Async calls on the same shard]

`asyncCall()` works even if the contract with the specified address is located on the same shard. The mechanism remains exactly the same as with cross-shard communications: the function will produce a new transaction, and the requested function in another contract will be executed whenever said transaction is processed by the shard. This usually occurs within the space of two-three blocks.
